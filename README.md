## Professional Summary

Experienced and independently-driven researcher with 10+ years in offensive cybersecurity, adversarial AI, and autonomous defense engineering. Recognized contributor to top-tier vulnerability programs including Google VRP, Microsoft MSRC, and select private bug bounty platforms.

Track record includes:
- Nation-state adversary simulation
- LLM red teaming and prompt injection testing
- C2 infrastructure engineering in air-gapped/hardened environments
- Real-time autonomous drone defense logic

Rooted in applied science and classical logic, I blend low-level system knowledge, red team precision, and AI systems design into cohesive threat-informed research.
